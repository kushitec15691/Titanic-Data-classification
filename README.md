# 🚢 Titanic Classification Project – Supervised Learning Lab

This project was completed as part of the Business Intelligence Lab 2 coursework at Dalarna University. The goal is to perform predictive analysis on the classic Titanic dataset using machine learning models — specifically Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers — to predict passenger survival.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Explore and understand the Titanic dataset structure
- Preprocess and clean data for modeling (handle missing values, encode categories, etc.)
- Build classification models: Decision Tree and Random Forest
- Evaluate model performance using training/test sets
- Visualize key findings and discuss insights
